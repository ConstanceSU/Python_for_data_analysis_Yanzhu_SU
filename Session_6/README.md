## Pandas I

**Pandas** is one of the most used libraries within the Data Science community. It provides a full set of tools to work with:
- 2D data via DataFrame class
    - SQL/Spreadsheet-like datasets (tabular data)
    - Arbitrary matrix data with row and column labels
    - Any type of dataset with observational / statistical data (no labels needed)
- 1D data via Series class
    - Time series data

As one can see, from the type of datasets **Pandas** can handle, most of the use cases found in Data Science are covered, e.g. finance, health, biology, supply chain, or meteorology. Things **Pandas** do:

1. Handling missing data
Missing values are usually represented as NaN(Not a Number)
2. Change DataFrame size, adding and removing columns and rows at will
3. Automatic data alignment of misaligned data
4. Group by operation
**groupby** any unique attributes within a column and get statistics:
count
mean
sum 
min & max
multiple aggregations
group using multiple columns

5. Data conversion
6. Advanced indexing
7. Data Merging and joining
8. Reshaping data
9. Hierarchical indexing
10. Read/write support for CSV, Excel, databases, and fast HDF5 format.
11. Time series manipulation, frequency convertion, window moving statistics
