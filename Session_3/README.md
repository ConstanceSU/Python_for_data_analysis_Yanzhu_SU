# Python Session 3 - Object oriented programming exercises done with examples of output

3 types of programming paradigms
1. Object-oriented programming
   organizes code using objects that represent real-world entities. It provides modularity, code reuse and abstraction, making it suitable for handling large and complex application.
   Main concepts of OOP:
  1) Class: A template to create objects
  2) Object: An instance of a class, representing a specific entity
  3) Attributes: Propertites of an object (variables within a class that define it)
  4) Methods: Actions that objects can perform (functions within a class)

2. Functional programming
   emphasizes the use of pure functions that can be easily composed and reused, ideal for transforming data

3. Declarative programming
   consists in specifying what the program should accomplish, rather than how to accomplish it.
